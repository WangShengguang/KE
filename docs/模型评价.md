Link Prediction
Link prediction aims to predict the missing h or t for a relation fact triple (h, r, t). In this task, for each position of missing entity, the system is asked to rank a set of candidate entities from the knowledge graph, instead of only giving one best result. For each test triple (h, r, t), we replace the head/tail entity by all entities in the knowledge graph, and rank these entities in descending order of similarity scores calculated by score function fr. we use two measures as our evaluation metric:

MR : mean rank of correct entities;  
MRR: the average of the reciprocal ranks of correct entities;  
Hit@N : proportion of correct entities in top-N ranked entities.
